### About CRUISE

Collaborative Human-Centric AI Systems (CRUISE) Lab, led by [Prof. Flora Salim](https://fsalim.github.io/), works on machine learning for time-series, spatio-temporal data, and multimodal sensor data, and on trustworthy AI (including fairness, explainability, mechanistic interpretablity) for decision making systems. Our research is supported by the ARC, CRC, and many local and international industry and government partners. We share our codes and some sample datasets in in our [CRUISE GitHub repository](https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup).
